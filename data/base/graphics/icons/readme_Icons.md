# Cute Dolphin Icon - DolphinHappy.png
© from https://www.twitch.tv/dolphinchemist - only used as placeholder & DebugIcon
Important: 
THAT'S NOT THE CREATOR OF THIS MOD. 
I only use his Icons as Placeholder as these Dolphins are sooooo cute... one day I should commission a own sticker pack by some artist. But until then maybe I change my persona anyway ^^.
If you see the Dolphin Ingame anywhere please inform me so I can replace him. Poor Dolphin :(

# Icons are sorted into different folders:
## original
Contains Icons as archive - for later use
## unchanged 
Contains Icons extracted from the main game and are used by the mod. 
These are here in case Ubisoft decides to remove/change any icons in a future patch.
## other
Contains Icons used by the mod and are changed variations of Icons from Ubisoft. 
Changed .kra file (Krita) should be in the repo for further modifications. 
### animals
Contains Animal Icons. Currently mostly from 1800 and modified with filters. 
## <name> e.g. celtic_druid
Contains a template file and varitaions of an item. For example an base Face of a celtic druid but with different clothes based on followed deity
## helpertemplates
Contains templates for various Items to be used like Bow, Arrows, Amphore, etc...
## old 
Variants I used initially but scrapped. Maybe will be used in Future.

## Naming Convention
Icons should use similar naming as the Item they are used by. 
This should help to link them with the corresponding Item.
Also the name should contain the gender of the Icon. This helps later for selecting corresponding Barks (AudioOutput when socketing the item).
# Info: 
I am not an artist and therefore some modifications are looking ... weird. Pls don't hate me QwQ.
